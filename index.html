    <h3>Display & Positioning</h3>
    <div class="css-intro">
    <p>The following properties can be used to specify where an element is located on a page:</p>
    <br>
    <ul class="css-intro-list">
      <li>Position</li>
      <li>Display</li>
      <li>Z-index</li>
      <li>Float</li>
      <li>Clear</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <section class="sub-section">
      <h4>Position</h4>
      <p>The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can
        take one of five values:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Static - the default value (does not need to be specified)</li>
        <li>Relative</li>
        <li>Absolute</li>
        <li>Fixed</li>
        <li>Sticky</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Relative</h5>
      <p>This value allows you to position an element /relative/ to its default static position on the web page.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="code-snippet">.green-box {
        background-color: green;
        position: relative;
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the code in the example above instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the .green-box
        element, it does not specify where the .green-box element should be positioned on the page. This is done by
        accompanying the position declaration with one or more of the following <span>offset properties</span> that will
        move the element away from its default static position:
      </p>
      <br>
      <uL>
        <li>top - moves the element down from the top.</li>
        <li>bottom - moves the element up from the bottom.</li>
        <li>left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right).</li>
        <li>right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left).</li>
      </uL>
      <br>
      <p>You can specify values in pixels, ems, or percentages, among others, to dial in exactly how far you need the
        element to move. It’s also important to note that offset properties will not work if the element’s position
        property is the default static.</p>

      <h5>Absolute</h5>
      <p>
        When an element’s position is set to absolute, all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act
        like it is not present on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent
        element, while offset properties can be used to determine the final position from there.
      </p>

      <h5>Fixed</h5>
      <p>
        You can <span>fix</span> an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting
        its
        position to fixed, and accompanying it with the familiar offset properties top, bottom, left, and right.
      </p>

      <h5>Sticky</h5>
      <p>
        The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element in the document flow as the user scrolls, but
        <span>sticks</span> to a specified position as the page is scrolled further. This is done by using the sticky
        value along
        with the familiar offset properties, as well as one new one.

      <h4>Display</h4>
      <p>
        Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other
        elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content.
        Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to other
        elements. <br> <br>
        There are three values for the display property:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Inline</li>
        <li>Block</li>
        <li>Inline-block</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        The default display for some elements, such as &lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;a&gt;, is called
        <span>inline</span>. Inline elements have
        a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display
        their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements
        cannot be specified in the CSS document. For example, the text of an anchor tag (&lt;a&gt;) will, by default, be
        displayed on the same line as the surrounding text, and it will only be as wide as necessary to contain
        its content. inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.
        <br>
        <br>
        The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that
        are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.
      </p>

      <h5>Display: Block</h5>
      <p>
        Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called
        <span>block-level</span>
        elements. These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set.
        Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.
        <br>
        <br>
        Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements (&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;),
        &lt;p&gt;,
        &lt;div&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;.
      </p>

      <h5>Display: Inline-block</h5>
      <p>
        Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next
        to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. Images are the best
        example of default inline-block elements.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="sub-section">
      <h4>Float</h4>
      <p>
        The float property is commonly used for wrapping text around an image. Note, however, that moving elements left
        or right for layout purposes is better suited for tools like CSS grid and flexbox.
        <br>
        <br>
        The float property is often set using one of the values below:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>left - moves, or floats, elements as far left as possible.</li>
        <li>right - moves elements as far right as possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        Floated elements must have a width specified, otherwise the element will assume the
        full width of its containing element, and changing the float value will not yield any visible results.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="sub-section">
      <h4>Clear</h4>
      <p>
        The float property can also be used to float multiple elements at once. However, when multiple floated elements
        have different heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can “bump” into each
        other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.
        <br>
        <br>
        The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can take
        on one of the following values:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>left—the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.</li>
        <li>right—the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
        </li>
        <li>both—neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.</li>
        <li>none—the element can touch either side.</li>
      </ul>
